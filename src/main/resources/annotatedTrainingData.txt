Yes,_because_the_materials_needed_cannot_be_found_in_this_country. declarative

No,_a_small_business_can_be_anything_from_a_grocery_store_to_a_lawyer’s_office. declarative
So_it_is_not_defined_by_the_kind_of_business_it_is. declarative
No,_a_small_business_is_defined_mainly_by_how_many_people_are_employed. declarative
What_is_the_largest_numbers_of_employees_you_can_have? interrogative
It_varies_by_country,_but_in_the_United_States,_if_you_have_less_than_500_employees,_you_are_considered_a_small_business. declarative
What_are_the_advantages_to_owning_a_small_business? interrogative
I_can_be_my_own_boss,_make_my_own_financial_decisions,_it_costs_less_to_start_up_and_I_will_have_a_closer_relationship_with_my_customers. declarative

I’ve always_wanted_to_be_an_entrepreneur. declarative
You_should_become_one. declarative
It_seems_very_risky. declarative
I_won’t_lie. declarative
It_is_risky. declarative
How_do_you_deal_with_the_risk? interrogative
Bigger_risks_bring_bigger_returns. declarative
That_is_a_good_way_to_look_at_it. declarative
It_is_worth_the_risk_to_be_my_own_boss. declarative

I_was_a_team_leader. declarative

Very_impressive! declarative
Mr._Johnson,_What_are_three_words_that_describe_you? interrogative

I_was_wondering_what_my_schedule_would_be_if_I_got_the_job? interrogative

You_would_work_from_Nine_until_Five,_Monday_through_Friday. declarative

I_sure_do! declarative
I_hate_when_they_change_color. declarative

It’s_not_too_much_trouble. declarative
Laundry_actually_isn’t_so_bad. declarative

Me_too! declarative
I_bet_it_costs_quite_a_bit_to_wash_all_of_those_clothes,_though. declarative
Yeah,_it_does. declarative
I_try_to_come_here_only_when_I_need_to. declarative

Thank_you,_sir. declarative
The_time_is_three_in_the_afternoon. declarative
So_right_now_it’s_3:00_PM declarative
Yes,_that’s_another_way_to_tell_time. declarative
Oh,_how_does_your_watch_tell_time? interrogative
It’s_an_analog_watch,_which_is_like_a_clock_with_the_long_hand_and_small_hand. declarative
That’s_interesting. declarative
Yes,_these_watches_are_more_traditional_than_digital_ones. declarative
don’t_digital_watches_tell_time_by_numbers_instead_of_analog’s_way? interrogative
Yes,_but_I_prefer_an_analog_watch_over_a_digital_watch. declarative
How_much_time_has_past_since_we_started_talking? interrogative
It’s_been_only_10_minutes. declarative
So_right_now_it_should_be_3:10_PM. declarative

It’s_almost_time_for_work_for_me. declarative
When_will_you_have_to_work? interrogative
Oh,_I_will_have_to_work_in_30_minutes. declarative
You_still_have_some_time_to_get_ready. declarative
I_also_have_to_wait_for_the_bus,_which_will_arrive_at_3:25_PM. declarative
My_bus_will_arrive_at_3:20_PM. declarative
What_time_is_it_right_now? interrogative
The_time_is_3:15_PM. declarative
So_I’ll_have_to_be_at_the_bus_stop_in_5_minutes. declarative
Bye. declarative
Okay,_good_bye. declarative
HI,_did_you_hear_about_the_weight_supplement_plan? interrogative
Yes,_I_heard_it_really_helps_your_body. declarative
How_much_weight_do_you_think_I’ll_lose? interrogative
I_think_you_will_lose_around_30_pounds_a_week. declarative
That’s_a_lot. declarative
It_certainly_is. declarative
It_sounds_dangerous. declarative
Don’t_worry,_it’s_completely_safe. declarative
I_might_order_some_because_I_need_to_lose_a_few_pounds. declarative
What_is_it_called? interrogative
It’s_called_Mini. declarative
That’s_a_weird_and_interesting_name. declarative
Great. declarative
I’ll_order_some_too. declarative
How_much_do_they_cost? interrogative
Twenty_dollars_per_month. declarative
That’s_pretty_cheap. declarative
It_is_cheap_I_guess. declarative
Do_you_really_think_I’ll_lose_weight? interrogative
Yes_I’m_pretty_positive_that_you_will_lose_weight. declarative
That’s_great_I_will_order_it_right_now. declarative
Me_too_I_will_order_a_few_packages_too. declarative
Let_us_both_order_at_the_same_time. imperative
Yes_we_should_do_that. declarative
Well_hopefully_I_can_lose_forty_pounds_by_tomorrow. declarative
I_don’t_know_how_I_am_going_to_pay_off_all_of_my_debt. declarative
Do_you_have_a_job? interrogative
Yes,_but_I_don’t_make_enough_money_to_pay_all_of_my_bills. declarative
Have_you_considered_filing_bankruptcy? interrogative
What_is_that? interrogative
When_you_file_bankruptcy,_you_are_essentially_wiping_your_financial_slate_clean. declarative
That_sounds_too_good_to_be_true. declarative
Yes,_there_are_disadvantages_to_it. declarative
What_are_the_advantages_first? interrogative
One_of_the_advantages_is_that_your_creditors_have_to_stop_collecting_from_you_as_soon_as_you_file. declarative
That_would_be_a_big_help_right_now. declarative
Another_benefit_is_that_once_it_is_all_done,_you_will_be_able_to_start_from_scratch. declarative
That_is_exactly_what_I_need. declarative
Yes_but_there_are_also_some_very_bad_disadvantages_to_filing_bankruptcy. declarative
What_is_the_down_side? interrogative
A_bankruptcy_goes_on_your_credit_report_for_up_to_ten_years. declarative
Why_would_that_be_a_bad_thing? interrogative
When_you_go_to_apply_for_future_credit,_it_will_be_harder_to_obtain_with_a_bankruptcy_on_your_record. declarative
So_if_I_want_to_buy_a_house,_I_might_not_be_able_to_do_so? interrogative
Exactly,_because_creditors_are_more_cautious_with_those_that_have_filed_bankruptcy. declarative
I_want_my_credit_to_be_as_good_as_possible. declarative
Do_you_think_you_will_be_able_to_pay_off_your_debts_within_five_years? interrogative
If_I_am_able_to_budget_well_with_my_current_pay,_then_yes_I_could. declarative
Then_I_wouldn’t_suggest_that_you_file_bankruptcy. declarative
You’re_right,_I_will_just_have_to_be_better_with_my_money_and_pay_off_my_debts. declarative
I_miss_my_home_country. declarative
So_do_i. declarative
Why_did_you_immigrate_here? interrogative
I_wanted_better_opportunities_to_provide_for_myself_and_for_my_family. declarative
What_about_you? interrogative
I’m_the_same. declarative
Do_you_think_immigration_is_a_good_thing? interrogative
I_do! declarative
I_think_it_helps_both_the_immigrant_and_the_country. declarative
How_so? interrogative
The_country_becomes_more_diverse. declarative
The_immigrant_has_new_opportunities. declarative
Some_people_think_immigration_is_bad. declarative
Yeah,_I_know. declarative
I_don’t_understand_why. declarative
Well,_I_think_that_too_many_immigrants_can_be_dangerous. declarative
Yeah,_there_should_be_a_limit_on_immigrants_to_countries. declarative
That_might_be_harsh_on_them. declarative
Maybe,_but_for_the_most_part,_immigrants_are_treated_pretty_well. declarative
Yeah,_this_country_treats_its_immigrants_well. declarative
I’m_glad_that_this_country_lets_immigrants_retain_their_culture. declarative
Learning_a_new_language_is_hard,_though. declarative
Yeah,_sometimes_I_wish_I didn’t have_to_learn_English. declarative

I_agree. declarative
Sometimes_I_think_immigration_rules_are_too_strict. declarative
I_don’t_think_they_are. declarative
They_should_be_strict_because_a_country_can’t_handle_too_many_immigrants. declarative

Immigration_is_wonderful_thing,_though! declarative
Yes_it_is. declarative
Good_afternoon,_do_you_know_where_the_bus_stop_is? interrogative

What_is_forensic_accounting? interrogative
It_is_the_investigation_and_interpretation_of_criminal_financial_transactions. declarative

Are_there_a_lot_of_employers_like_that_around_here? interrogative
No,_I_have_not_found_very_many. declarative
Maybe_you_should_look_into_something_different. declarative
I_only_like_performing_the_job_that_I_had_before. declarative
But_if_there_are_no_employers_in_that_field,_you_will_not_find_employment. declarative
You’re_right. declarative
I_will_start_looking_at_other_opportunities. declarative
Any_job_that_you_can_find_will_make_you_more_money_than_your_unemployment_benefits. declarative
My_unemployment_benefits_help_but_they_are_not_enough_to_pay_everything. declarative
Would_you_like_my_help_looking_for_a_job? interrogative
Yes,_it_would_be_very_nice_if_you_would_help_me. declarative
How_long_have_you_and_Marie_been_married? interrogative

We_are_going_to_get_dinner_and_go_to_a_movie. declarative
I’ll_talk_to_Bill_about_it_and_let_you_know. declarative
Alright,_see_you_later. imperative
Isn’t learning_a_foreign_language_hard? interrogative
It’s_not_that_hard. declarative

How_about_yours? interrogative
Mine_is_French. declarative
Oh,_cool. declarative

How_did_you_learn_English? interrogative
I_took_classes_in_school. declarative
I_taught_myself. declarative
I_started_by_studying_vocabulary,_and_then_simple_phrases. declarative
That’s_really_cool. declarative
How_do_you_remember_vocabulary? interrogative
The_best_way_for_me_is_to_use_flashcards. declarative
I_like_to_write_vocabulary_words_many_times. declarative
That_helps_me_too. declarative
So,_you_know_a_lot_of_languages. declarative
I_studied_them_a_lot_when_I_was_a_child. declarative
They_say_it’s_easier_to_learn_a_foreign_language_when_you_are_a_child. declarative
I_agree_with_that. declarative
It_gets_harder_as_I_get_older. declarative
I_guess_that’s_why_I_only_know_two! declarative
Too_bad. declarative
Knowing_a_lot_of_languages_can_be_really_helpful. declarative
Well,_if_you_travel_a_lot,_it’s_easier_when_you_can_communicate_with_others. declarative
What_if_you_don’t_travel_a_lot? interrogative
It’s_still_nice_to_know_about_other_cultures. declarative
Do_you_study_culture_when_you_study_language? interrogative
Well,_I_think_that_language_is_part_of_culture. declarative
Oh,_that’s_true. declarative
Learning_about_culture_is_also_very_interesting. declarative
Yeah,_it_is. declarative
There’s_a_lot_you_have_to_learn_to_speak_a_language_well. declarative
You_have_to_learn_to_write_that_language,_too. declarative
You_also_have_to_be_able_to_read_and_understand_it! declarative
Yeah,_it_really_is_a_lot_of_work. declarative
It’s_worth_it,_though. declarative
Hey_there,_how_are_you_doing? interrogative

Okay,_see_you_there! imperative
Does_your_grandfather_still_work_for_the_railroad_company? interrogative
No,_he_retired_last_year. declarative
I_thought_you_had_to_be_a_certain_age_before_you_could_retire. declarative
He_would_have_had_to_wait_until_he_was_67,_but_he_hurt_his_back. declarative
And_now_he_cannot_physically_do_his_job_anymore? interrogative
Exactly,_so_his_company_allowed_him_to_have_early_retirement. declarative
Will_he_still_be_able_to_receive_his_pension? interrogative
Yes,_because_his_age_does_qualify_him_for_early_retirement. declarative
What_about_Social_Security_benefits? interrogative
No,_he_will_have_to_wait_until_he_is_67_to_receive_them. declarative
How_long_did_he_work_for_the_railroad_company? interrogative
He_was_there_for_over_thirty_years. declarative
Will_that_affect_how_much_of_a_pension_he_will_receive? interrogative
Yes,_because_he_worked_for_over_thirty_years,_he_will_receive_three_quarters_of_his_usual_pay. declarative
What_if_he_had_only_worked_there_for_twenty_years? interrogative
Then_they_would_have_only_given_him_half_of_his_pay_for_pension. declarative
What_will_he_do_now_that_he_is_retired? interrogative
He_has_always_wanted_to_travel_around_the_country_with_my_grandmother. declarative

Will_he_move_into_a_retirement_home_when_they_return? interrogative

What_else_will_he_do_with_all_his_extra_time_now? interrogative
When_he_returns_he_plans_to_start_a_hobby. declarative
The_perfect_hobby_for_him_would_be_to_build_toy_trains! declarative
I_just_got_into_a_small_accident_with_my_new_car. declarative
Are_you_alright? interrogative
I_have_a_small_headache,_but_other_than_that_I_am_fine. declarative
What_happened? interrogative
I_was_not_paying_attention_when_I_was_looking_for_a_parking_spot_and_I_hit_another_car. declarative
Did_you_hit_it_head_on_or_on_the_side? interrogative
I_ran_into_their_back_bumper_as_they_were_backing_out_of_a_parking_space. declarative
Was_the_other_driver_hurt_at_all? interrogative
No,_thankfully_it_only_jostled_her_a_little_bit. declarative
Wow,_it’s_a_good_thing_that_you_have_insurance. declarative
I_am_so_thankful_that_I_pay_a_little_extra_every_month_for_full_coverage. declarative
What_is_the_difference_between_full_coverage_and_liability_only? interrogative
Full_coverage_costs_more,_but_it_will_pay_more_to_have_your_car_fixed_if_you_get_into_an_accident. declarative
So_you_won’t_have_to_pay_for_the_damages_to_your_car_from_the_accident_today. declarative
I_have_to_pay_a_small_deductible,_but_it_is_still_a_lot_less_than_I_would_have_to_pay_to_fix_the_car_myself. declarative
What_would_liability_cover? interrogative
Liability_would_only_take_care_of_damages_to_someone_else’s_car,_but_not_mine. declarative
Does_your_insurance_cover_the_damage_to_the_other_car_too? interrogative
Usually_it_would,_but_the_other_driver_did_not_have_any_insurance. declarative
If_a_driver_does_not_have_insurance_then_you_are_not_responsible_for_damages_to_their_car? interrogative
Yes,_because_you_are_not_supposed_to_drive_at_all_unless_you_have_insurance. declarative
Did_you_receive_a_ticket_for_the_accident? interrogative
Yes,_the_police_officer_gave_me_a_small_ticket_because_it_was_my_fault. declarative
Did_the_other_driver_receive_a_ticket_too? interrogative
Yes,_their_ticket_was_higher_because_they_did_not_have_insurance_while_driving. declarative
I_wonder_if_the_other_driver_knew_how_important_it_is_to_have_car_insurance. declarative
If_she_did_not_know_before_the_accident,_I_hope_she_knows_now. declarative

Why_don’t_you_do_that_online,_it_will_be_much_quicker. declarative
I_don’t_know_how_to_check_my_account_online. declarative
All_you_have_to_do_is_set_up_an_account_with_your_bank’s_website. declarative
Then_I_will_be_able_to_access_my_account_on_the_internet? interrogative
Exactly,_and_you_will_not_have_to_actually_go_to_your_bank. declarative
I_don’t_think_that_it_will_be_as_secure_online. declarative
Everything_that_you_do_with_your_online_banking_account_is_just_as_secure_as_going_to_the_bank. declarative
But_my_bank_closes_early_today_and_I_have_to_be_there_before_they_close. declarative
Online_banking_never_closes_and_you_can_access_your_account_24_hours_a_day. declarative
I_was_also_going_to_check_on_my_IRA_account_while_I_was_at_the_bank_today. declarative
Online_banking_lets_you_check_on_any_accounts_you_have_at_the_bank,_even_IRA’s_or_CD’s. declarative
I_am_going_out_of_town_this_weekend_and_need_to_transfer_funds_from_my_savings_account_to_my_checking. declarative
Online_banking_lets_you_access_your_account_anywhere_there_is_internet_access. declarative
So_even_if_I_am_in_a_town_that_does_not_have_my_bank,_I_will_still_be_able_to_transfer_my_funds? interrogative
Yes,_there_are_many_advantages_to_having_an_online_banking_account. declarative
Well_there_must_also_be_disadvantages. declarative
There_are_a_few. declarative
You_may_have_to_go_to_your_bank_to_set_up_your_online_account. declarative
And_I_will_have_to_learn_how_to_navigate_the_website. declarative
It_is_also_a_good_idea_to_print_out_any_transactions_as_proof_in_case_there_is_a_problem_with_the_website. declarative

Why doesn’t the_doctor_write_it_down_himself? interrogative
Doctor’s_are_very_busy_with_patients_and_don’t_have_time_to_write_everything_down. declarative
Why_is_it_important_to_write_it_down_at_all? interrogative
So_the_doctor’s_have_something_to_look_at_the_next_time_they_see_their_patient. declarative
You_do_all_of_this_here_at_home? interrogative

What_if_you_need_medicine? interrogative
My_health_insurance_will_also_pay_for_many_medicines. declarative

A_lot_of_times,_people_just_need_to_talk_about_their_stress. declarative
So_you_listen_to_them? interrogative
Yes,_and_I_give_them_advice_sometimes_too. declarative
That_sounds_really_helpful. declarative
I_like_to_think_so,_but_stress_can_even_be_helpful_sometimes. declarative
It_sure doesn’t seem_like_it. declarative
I_think_it_helps_motivate_people. declarative
I_agree,_as_long_as_you’re_not_getting_too_stressed_out! declarative
Yeah,_that’s_when_you_have_to_relax_a_bit. declarative

Me_too,_your_birthday_was_awesome_last_year. imperative
I_hope_this_year_is_going_to_be_better. declarative
That’s_hard_to_accomplish. declarative
I_know,_but_I_have_a_feeling_that_it_would. declarative
Birthdays_only_happen_once_a_year,_so_it_should_be_really_awesome. declarative
Yes,_so_I’m_hoping_for_something_great. declarative
Are_you_having_a_giant_cake? interrogative
Yes,_and_hopefully_a_lot_of_gifts. declarative
Maybe,_but_you_shouldn’t_be_expecting_too_much. declarative
It’s_all_about_celebrating_the_day_of_your_birth! declarative
This_year_is_also_going_to_have_a_lot_of_people_at_your_party. declarative
I_know_my_friends_are_preparing_to_give_me_a_big_surprise. declarative
How_would_you_know? interrogative
They’re_horrible_at_keeping_secrets. declarative
But_they_can’t_help_it. declarative
The_more_I_think_about_my_birthday,_the_more_I_get_excited. declarative
I_think_my_parents_planned_out_the_whole_party_already. declarative

Every_day? interrogative
Yes,_the_more_water,_the_better! declarative
Okay,_what_else? declarative
Also,_you_need_to_cut_your_grass_at_least_every_four_to_five_days. declarative
Why_is_that_important. interrogative
Because_it_will_keep_killing_the_weeds_in_the_yard! declarative
Oh_yeah! imperative
Also,_make_sure_you_edge_and_weed-whack_the_extra_grass. imperative
Why_do_you_do_that? interrogative
It_makes_the_grass_look_pretty_from_the_street. declarative
That_make_sense. declarative
I’m_pretty_proud_of_my_yard! declarative
You_should_be! declarative
It_could_win_contests! declarative
You_think_so? interrogative
Maybe_I_should_enter_some! declarative
You’d_be_the_favorite_to_win_in_my_view. declarative
I’ll_have_to_find_some! declarative

What_is_it? interrogative
It_says_here_that_you_have_difficulty_filling_out_the_weekly_reports. declarative
Yes,_that’s_true. declarative
Why_is_that? interrogative
I_feel_like_I_was_never_properly_trained_on_how_to_fill_the_reports_out,_and I’ve never_asked_for_training. declarative
They_are_more_important_than_you_might_think. declarative
Well,_now_that_I_know_I_will_gladly_learn_how. declarative

What_can_I_help_you_with? interrogative
Well,_I’m_looking_for_something_fashionable_to_buy_my_daughter. declarative
Alright,_how_old_is_she? interrogative
She’s_fifteen. declarative
Girls_that_age_are_usually_on_top_of_fashion. declarative
Yes,_she’s_very_fashionable;_unfortunately,_I’m_not. declarative
Well,_you_came_to_the_right_store. declarative
Only_because_my_daughter_recommended_it. declarative
Don’t_worry,_I’m_here_to_help_you_out. declarative

Well,_the_young_woman’s_department_is_right_over_there. declarative

It_is_my_pleasure. declarative
I’m_guessing_you_know_what_our_meeting_is_about? interrogative
To_be_honest,_I’m_not_quite_certain. declarative
Well,_the_HR_department_is_discussing_benefits_with_each_individual_employee. declarative
I_understand. declarative
Well,_let’s_get_started. declarative
Okay,_Let’s_talk_about_your_insurance. declarative
The_company_pays_for_my_health_insurance_but_I_pay_for_dental_insurance_myself. declarative
Yes,_unfortunately_our_company_does_not_have_a_dental_plan. declarative
Will_that_change_anytime_soon? interrogative
We_are_working_on_adding_more_benefits_for_our_employees. declarative
Well,_a_dental_plan_would_be_nice. declarative
I_will_take_that_into_consideration. declarative
Now_let’s_discuss_your_401k. declarative
My_retirement_fund? interrogative
The_company_will_match_the_money_you_contribute_up_to_6%_of_your_salary. declarative
I_think_right_now_I_am_only_contributing_4%. declarative
It_says_here_that_you_are_contributing_4%_to_your_401k. declarative
Can_I_increase_that? interrogative
Yes_you_can. declarative
You_will_need_to_fill_out_a_request_form_in_order_to_do_that. declarative
Where_can_I_get_the_form? interrogative
I_can_print_one_off_for_you. declarative
I’d_appreciate_that. declarative
Do_you_have_any_questions_about_your_benefits? interrogative
Just_keep_me_posted_about_the_dental_plan. imperative
My_sister_will_be_working_abroad_for_the_next_year. declarative
What_does_it_mean_to_work_abroad? interrogative
She_is_travelling_to_another_country_to_work. declarative
Why_doesn’t_she_stay_here_to_work? interrogative
She_has_always_wanted_to_travel_to_other_countries. declarative
Which_country_is_she_going_to? interrogative
She_will_spend_her_first_six_months_in_Australia. declarative
What_kind_of_work_does_she_do? interrogative
She_is_a_nurse,_so_she_will_be_able_to_find_work_easily. declarative
Can_she_not_find_work_in_this_country? interrogative
Yes,_she_is_already_employed_with_a_hospital. declarative
Are_they_making_her_work_abroad? interrogative
No,_this_is_something_that_she_wants_to_do_and_volunteered_for_it. declarative
How_is_she_going_to_pay_for_all_the_travelling_expenses? interrogative
There_are_certain_programs_that_specifically_help_people_that_are_working_abroad. declarative
Why_does_she_want_to_go_to_Australia? interrogative
She_wants_to_meet_new_people,_eat_new_foods_and_explore_a_new_land. declarative
Where_will_she_go_after_her_six_months_in_Australia? interrogative
She_hasn’t_decided_yet,_but_she_might_go_to_China. declarative
Are_nurses_the_only_ones_that_work_abroad? interrogative
No,_many_occupations_travel_to_different_countries,_especially_teachers. declarative
I_can_understand_why_a_nurse_would_go,_but_why_a_teacher? interrogative
Many_countries_like_to_hire_teachers_to_teach_a_foreign_language. declarative
So_a_teacher_from_England_would_teach_English_in_China. declarative
Exactly,_and_a_teacher_from_China_would_teach_Chinese_in_England. declarative
It_sounds_very_exciting. declarative
I’m_going_to_see_if_my_job_can_go_abroad! declarative
Hey,_do_you_like_this_classroom? interrogative
Yeah,_it’s_small,_clean,_and_new. declarative
I_also_like_my_classmates_and_my_teacher. declarative
I_agree,_but_I_would_like_to_have_more_than_one_teacher_because_I_learn_better_that_way. declarative
I_don’t_like_having_assigned_seats_either. declarative
I_don’t_think_the_teacher_should_assign_seats_to_students_because_I_like_to_sit_with_my_friends. declarative
I_do_like_the_classroom_though. declarative
Yeah,_it’s_small_and_pretty_relaxed. declarative
I_like_the_layout,_too. declarative
The_layout_is_okay. declarative
I_think_it’d_be_better_if_all_the_desks_faced_forward_and_the_teacher’s_desk_was_at_the_front_and_corner,_facing_the_students. declarative
Well,_that’s_easier_to_do_when_there_are_less_students. declarative
Yeah,_I_like_classrooms_with_few_students_because_I_feel_like_I_learn_better. declarative
So,_what_bothers_you_about_the_classroom? interrogative
Well,_sometimes_it_is_too_hot. declarative
I_also_don’t_like_the_desks;_they_are_uncomfortable. declarative
I_don’t_like_the_homework_or_classwork_when_it_is_too_hard,_and_I_don’t_like_the_chalkboard_because_it_is_too_small. declarative
Yeah,_If_I_could,_I_would_get_a_bigger_chalkboard. declarative
And_I’d_get_some_more_comfortable_desks! declarative
What_would_make_them_more_comfortable? interrogative
Well,_the_desks_would_be_movable_so_we_could_sit_where_we_wanted,_and_they_wouldn’t_be_attached_to_the_chairs. declarative
If_I_could_improve_the_classroom,_I_would_also_make_the_air_conditioning_system_better. declarative
I_think_we_should_get_more_breaks_from_studying. declarative
We_spend_way_too_much_time_in_here. declarative
Agreed! imperative
We’re_in_here_at_least_6_hours_every_day. declarative
I_wish_we_changed_classrooms_more_often_because_I_get_bored_easily. declarative
What_do_you_do_to_pass_the_time? interrogative
When_I_get_bored,_I_stare_out_the_window_for_hours. declarative
Even_though_I_get_bored,_I_still_think_the_classroom_is_a_good_place_to_study_because_it_is_usually_quiet. declarative
I_think_it’s_too_quiet. declarative
At_least,_it_is_where_I_sit. declarative
You_sit_in_the_front,_don’t_you? interrogative
You_sit_with_all_the_smart_kids. declarative
You_sit_closer_to_the_back,_correct? interrogative
I_like_where_I_sit_because_I_sit_next_to_the_window,_and_the_students_that_sit_around_me_are_nice. declarative
Even_though_you’re_in_the_back,_they’re_still_pretty_smart,_and_they_pay_attention. declarative
We_should_probably_pay_more_attention. declarative
Yeah,_class_isn’t_that_bad. declarative
Let’s_go! imperative
Good_afternoon! declarative
Hello! imperative

Did_you_find_anything? interrogative
I_did,_in_fact. declarative
Here,_I’ll_write_down_the_call_number_for_you. declarative
Sorry,_I_don’t_come_to_libraries_often. declarative
This_might_be_hard_to_find. declarative
It’s_fine,_I’ll_go_get_it_for_you. declarative
So,_how_long_may_I_have_the_book_checked_out? interrogative
You_can_have_the_book_for_three_weeks. declarative
How_much_are_fines_after_that? interrogative
Every_day_you_don’t_turn_it_in_after_3_weeks,_you’re_charged_10_cents. declarative
I’ll_try_to_get_it_in_then! declarative
Do_you_have_a_library_card? interrogative
Awesome,_will_that_be_the_only_book_for_you_today? interrogative
Actually,_I_think_I’ll_browse_for_a_little_bit. declarative
Hope_you_enjoy_your_visit! imperative

I_smoke. declarative
I_used_to_smoke_too. declarative
I_really_want_to_quit_but_I_can’t. declarative
Have_you_tried_chewing_gum? interrogative
I_have_tried_gum_and_it_didn’t_work_for_me. declarative
Have_you_tried_nicotine_patches? interrogative
Those_were_better_than_the_gum_but_still_didn’t_work. declarative
I_used_a_quit_smoking_program. declarative
Really_what_did_you_do? interrogative
I_did_a_lot_of_different_things. declarative
I_drank_grapefruit_juice_and_brushed_my_teeth. declarative
That_would_make_a_cigarette_taste_horrible. declarative
That’s_why_I_did_it. declarative
What_else_did_you_do? interrogative
I_made_sure_I_ate_a_good_breakfast_and_didn’t_drink_coffee. declarative
Why_didn’t_you_drink_coffee? interrogative
Because_I_always_smoked_after_I_drank_coffee_so_I_decided_to_stop. declarative
I_still_don’t_drink_it_actually. declarative
What_else? interrogative
I_had_my_friend_hide_my_cigarettes. declarative
That_would_be_hard. declarative
I_really_want_to_quit_but_I_don’t_think_I_can_do_it_alone. declarative
If_you_want_I_can_help_you_quit. declarative
It_will_take_a_lot_of_will_power_but_with_help,_you_can_do_it. declarative
This_time,_I_am_determined. declarative
Hey_man declarative
Hey! imperative
Good_to_see_you. imperative
Not_bad,_you? interrogative
Hot. declarative
Too_hot. declarative
Can_you_believe_this_summer_we’re_having? interrogative
I’ve_been_working_as_a_roofer_this_summer. declarative
That_must_be_brutal_in_this_heat. declarative
Somehow_I_haven’t_fainted_yet_while_on_a_roof. declarative
Well,_staying_alive_in_the_heat_is_all_about_staying_hydrated. declarative
I_drink_at_least_three_Gatorades_a_day. declarative
Dude,_I_don’t_know_if_that’s_good_for_you. declarative
Why_wouldn’t_it_be? interrogative
Gatorade_has_a_lot_of_sugar. declarative
In_this_heat_your_best_bet_is_just_water. declarative
But_I_need_my_electrolytes_to_keep_me_going. declarative
I_don’t_know,_people_have_done_fine_with_just_water_for_thousands_of_years. declarative
Yeah_but_have_those_people_ever_had_to_roof_a_house_in_a_hundred_degree_weather? interrogative
Well,_some_of_them_must_have. declarative
Well,_too_much_sugar_or_not,_Gatorade_gets_me_through_the_hottest_days. declarative
More_power_to_you,_man. declarative
I_get_to_work_in_air_conditioning,_so_I_shouldn’t_really_complain. declarative
Lucky. imperative
Just_a_boring_office_job,_but_it_keeps_me_out_of_the_sun_so_I’m_happy. declarative
You’re_not_a_real_“summer_guy”_are_you? interrogative
Nope. declarative
I’m_just_waiting_for_fall_to_get_here_so_I_can_feel_a_cool_breeze_on_my_face. declarative
Yeah,_that_will_be_nice. declarative
Until_then,_I’m_beating_the_heat_with_plenty_of_water_and_AC. declarative
Well,_enjoy_your_temperature-controlled_work_environment. imperative
And_you_enjoy_the_sun. declarative
I_gotta_run_but_I’m_sure_I’ll_talk_to_you_later. declarative
It_was_good_running_into_you. declarative
Catch_you_later. imperative
Were_you_able_to_get_funding_for_your_startup? interrogative
Yes,_but_not_as_much_as_we_need. declarative
It_is_exciting. declarative
How_much_capital_have_you_raised_so_far? interrogative
$10,000. declarative
How_much_more_do_you_need? interrogative
We_feel_we_will_need_$40,000_of_over_head. declarative
Are_you_looking_for_investors_or_loans? interrogative
We_would_prefer_investors_but_we_might_need_to_take_out_a_loan. declarative
Who_are_your_investors? interrogative
We_presented_to_a_few_venture_capital_groups_and_got_$10,000. declarative
Do_you_know_of_anyone_else? interrogative
I_know_a_few_angel_investors. declarative
I_would_prefer_angel_investors_over_taking_out_a_loan. declarative
I_can_give_you_their_contact_information. declarative
Why_don’t_you_want_to_take_out_a_loan? interrogative
Because_I_don’t_care_too_much_about_my_equity_in_the_company. declarative
Also,_I_definitely_do_not_want_to_pay_interest_in_case_things_don’t_work_out. declarative
That_is_smart. declarative
It’s_better_to_be_safe_than_sorry. declarative
I’m_going_to_use_my_car_in_order_to_go_to_work. declarative
Oh,_I_only_drive_my_car_sometimes_when_I_go_to_work. declarative
Then_how_do_you_usually_go_to_work? interrogative
I_just_use_a_bicycle_because_where_I_work_is_not_that_far_away. declarative
Is_it_only_a_few_miles_away? interrogative
Yeah,_using_a_bike_saves_me_money_on_gas_for_my_car. declarative
That’s_very_good. declarative
I_also_rarely_take_the_bus_for_work. declarative
I_ride_the_bus_more_than_I_drive_my_car. declarative
Wow,_that’s_surprising. declarative
A_car_is_incredibly_useful_and_usually_my_only_mode_of_transportation. declarative
I_used_to_be_like_you,_almost_always_using_my_car_to_get_to_any_destination. declarative
A_motor_vehicle_is_the_fastest_way_to_go_anywhere. declarative
Yeah,_but_my_bike_helps_me_keep_my_body_fit. declarative
For_very_long_distances,_I_use_a_train_or_an_airplane. declarative
It_would_be_great_to_use_an_airplane. declarative
That’s_because_it’s_very_fast_for_any_far_away_destination. declarative
I’ll_start_to_ride_a_bike_to_get_to_my_workplace. declarative
Good_because_it’s_the_most_physically_active_way_to_go_there. declarative
And_I’ll_become_more_fit. declarative
If_you’re_dedicated_to_biking,_then_you_will_save_more_money_on_gas. declarative
Biking_as_a_mode_of_transportation_holds_a_lot_of_benefits. declarative
It’s_definitely_awesome_to_feel_a_fresh_breeze_as_you_bike_anywhere. declarative
I’ll_actually_start_riding_my_bike_as_soon_as_possible. declarative
Don’t_forget_to_buy_a_biking_helmet. imperative
I_will_buy_one_first. declarative
I’m_glad_that_our_company_is_starting_to_be_more_eco-friendly declarative
We_have_started_to_recycle_plastic_bottles_and_aluminum_cans. declarative
My_family_has_started_to_bring_our_own_bag_to_the_grocery_store_instead_of_using_plastic_bags. declarative
That_is_a_great_way_to_consume_less. declarative
What_else_are_people_you_know_doing_to_“go_green”? interrogative
My_neighbor_bought_a_hybrid_car. declarative
The_kind_that_runs_on_electricity? interrogative
He_gets_great_gas_mileage. declarative
One_of_my_co-workers_has_a_car_that_runs_on_natural_gas. declarative
I_heard_that_is_a_lot_less_expensive. declarative
He_saves_a_lot_of_money. declarative
Our_company_just_funded_a_project_to_build_two_windmills. declarative
We_will_also_have_a_field_of_solar_panels_to_power_our_headquarters declarative
My_uncle_put_a_big_solar_panel_on_the_roof_of_his_house. declarative
That_is_an_interesting_idea. declarative
It_is_hardly_noticeable_and_it_saves_him_money_on_the_electric_bill. declarative
Why_are_they_arguing? interrogative
They_are_fighting_over_a_girl. declarative
Who? interrogative
Luna_Lovegood! declarative
Luna_Lovegood? interrogative

They_are_very_odd. declarative
Well,_I_hear_she’s_nice. declarative
Oh,_she_is_very_nice! declarative
That’s_what_matters. declarative
Yes,_that_is_true. declarative
So,_why_are_they_fighting_over_her. interrogative
They_each_want_to_ask_her_to_the_Yule_Ball. declarative
Who_asked_her_first? interrogative
No_one_has_yet! declarative
That’s_why_they_are_fighting! declarative
They_should_play_rock,_paper,_scissors. declarative
Yeah,_that_would_settle_it. declarative
You_should_tell_them_that! declarative
Maybe_I_will. declarative
But_first,_let_them_vent. declarative
Yeah,_that’s_a_good_idea. declarative
I_don’t_want_to_get_hit! declarative
Why_should_you! declarative

What_is_manufacturing? interrogative
It_is_the_use_of_machines,_tools_and_labor_to_make_goods_for_use_or_sale. declarative
What_does_your_company_manufacture? interrogative
Our_company_uses_raw_materials_to_create_engine_parts. declarative
Do_you_sell_your_engine_parts_directly_to_consumers? interrogative
A_small_amount_of_our_finished_products_are_sold_to_consumers. declarative
And_the_rest_are_sold_to_other_manufacturers. declarative
Yes,_and_they_use_our_finished_products_for_more_complex_products_like_airplanes. declarative
Does_your_company_use_a_specific_kind_of_manufacturing? interrogative
Our_factory_uses_mass_production_to_create_our_parts. declarative
And_what_is_mass_production? interrogative
It_is_the_production_of_large_amounts_of_products,_usually_with_the_aid_of_an_assembly_line. declarative
I_thought_that_assembly_lines_only_had_people_on_them. declarative
No,_many_assembly_lines_use_machines_that_are_controlled_by_people. declarative
So_the_machines_do_the_work,_and_the_people_just_make_sure_it_is_done_right. declarative
Exactly,_and_that_is_how_our_goods_are_produced_from_raw_materials. declarative
How_do_you_know_that_every_product_comes_out_right? interrogative
Every_manufacturing_company_has_some_sort_of_quality_control. declarative
It_checks_to_finished_products_to_make_sure_they_are_correct. declarative
Quality_control_can’t_check_every_single_piece,_because_it_is_a_system_of_checking_random_pieces. declarative
So_some_bad_products_might_make_it_out_the_door. declarative
Yes,_but_it_is_very_unlikely. declarative
With_manufacturing,_there_is_some_risk,_but_overall_it_is_very_important_to_society. declarative
Exactly,_because_without_manufacturing,_we_would_not_have_the_goods_that_we_depend_on. declarative
I_want_to_start_my_own_business,_but_I_need_ideas_for_raising_the_money. declarative
There_are_many_ways_to_raise_money_for_your_business. declarative
What_ideas_do_you_have? interrogative
Well,_first_you_should_look_into_different_start_up_sources. declarative
I_have_looked_in_my_community_for_resources_available_to_me,_but_have_had_no_luck. declarative
Then_you_should_inquire_at_your_bank_for_a_business_loan. declarative
I_did_try_to_get_a_loan_from_my_bank,_but_they_do_not_want_to_help_me. declarative
Then_you_should_definitely_market_your_idea_to_a_private_investor. declarative
I_don’t_want_to_rely_on_someone_to_guarantee_my_loan. declarative
Well,_if_you_have_a_product_that_you_are_sure_will_make_money,_then_look_into_royalty_financing. declarative
You_will_provide_the_proof_of_your_future_sales_to_secure_a_loan_now. declarative
That_is_a_much_better_idea,_I’m_sure_I_will_be_able_to_get_a_loan_that_way. declarative
After_you_have_your_loan,_what_else_will_you_need? interrogative
I_am_looking_for_an_office_and_I_am_also_going_to_need_a_lot_of_special_equipment. declarative
You_can_just_lease_the_items_you_need_until_you_can_afford_to_buy_them. declarative
Well_that_makes_me_feel_better. declarative
What_other_obstacles_are_you_facing_to_raise_money_for_your_business? interrogative
I’m_afraid_that_once_I_get_started,_it_won’t_make_enough_money. declarative
Then_you_should_consider_selling_shares_of_your_new_company_to_the_public. declarative
How_will_that_help_me? interrogative
If_more_people_are_financially_invested_in_your_business,_they_will_be_more_concerned_about_it_succeeding. declarative
That_is_a_wonderful_idea,_but_what_if_I_can’t_find_enough_people_to_buy_shares? interrogative
You_can_always_look_into_angel_investors,_but_it_will_mean_giving_up_a_portion_of_your_company. declarative
Well,_if_they_can_get_my_business_of_the_ground_and_keep_it_running,_it_would_be_worth_it. declarative
Good_luck_with_raising_money_for_your_business. declarative
Thank_you_for_all_of_your_great_ideas. imperative

That’s_a_great_idea! declarative
Yeah,_I_did_that_for_my_girlfriend_a_few_years_ago_and_she_still_has_it. declarative
That’s_much_better_than_a_piece_of_jewelry_that_might_break_or_get_lost. declarative
Definitely. declarative
So_what_are_you_doing_with_your_girlfriend_this_Valentine’s_Day? interrogative
I’m_taking_her_to_see_a_show_in_the_city. declarative

Yeah,_I’m_excited_and_so_is_she. declarative

Well,_I_really_like_building_model_trains_and_cars. declarative
Those_look_like_a_lot_of_work. declarative
Yeah,_they_are,_but_they_look_really_cool_after_you’re_done. declarative
What_else_do_you_do_in_your_free_time? interrogative
I_like_to_swim_and_play_piano. declarative

Do_you_jog_on_trails? interrogative
Yeah,_I_love_the_outdoors. declarative
You_should_come_to_the_park_with_me. declarative
Okay,_let’s_go! declarative
Budget_plumbing,_this_is_Peter. declarative
I_have_a_few_problems_in_my_bathroom_and_I_was_wondering_if_someone_could_do_a_house_call? declarative
What_seems_to_be_the_problem? interrogative
Well_there_is_a_leak_in_the_sink. declarative
Did_you_try_tightening_the_pipes? interrogative

Any_rain_right_now_would_be_pointless. declarative
That's_right,_it_really_would_be. declarative
I_want_it_to_cool_down_some. declarative
I_know_what_you_mean,_I_can't_wait_until_it's_winter. declarative
Winter_is_great. declarative

That_would_make_it_easier_for_us_to_make_plans. declarative
Things_are_easier_when_you_know_what_the_weather's_going_to_be_like. declarative
Well,_it_was_nice_talking_to_you. declarative
It_was_nice_talking_to_you_too. declarative

All_right,_so_I'll_see_you_then. declarative
I'll_call_you_later. declarative
Okay,_I'll_talk_to_you_later_then. declarative

The_lighting_has_always_been_bad,_but_it_seems_to_be_getting_worse. declarative
We_are_trying_to_save_electricity,_so_we_put_in_new_energy-saving_bulbs. declarative

Whatever_the_problem_is,_it_needs_to_be_fixed. declarative
Why_do_you_feel_this_is_so_unsafe? interrogative

I_am_not_sure_that_having_a_few_shadows_here_and_there_is_such_a_problem. declarative

I'm_moving_out. declarative
Your_lease_isn't_up_yet. declarative
I_won't_be_able_to_stay_here_anymore. declarative
That's_going_to_be_a_problem. declarative
I_don't_know_why_there's_a_problem. declarative
It's_a_problem_because_I_can't_give_you_your_deposit_back. declarative
Why_can't_you_give_it_back_to_me? interrogative
You're_breaking_our_contract. declarative
I'm_going_to_need_my_deposit_back. declarative

I'm_going_to_be_moving_out_soon. declarative
You_still_have_time_on_your_lease. declarative
There's_no_way_that_I_can_stay_here. declarative
That's_not_going_to_be_all_right. declarative
I_don't_understand_why. declarative
I'm_going_to_have_to_keep_your_deposit declarative
Why_can't_I_have_it_back? interrogative
Because_you're_leaving_before_your_lease_is_over. declarative
You_have_to_give_it_back_to_me. declarative
You're_not_going_to_get_it. declarative
But_I'm_not_able_to_live_here_anymore. declarative
I_can't_help_you_with_that. declarative

Did_the_potential_buyers_offer_a_good_price? interrogative
There_were_offers_above_and_below_your_asking_price,_as_well_as_one_exactly_for_the_asking_price. declarative
The_highest_bid_is_always_the_best_bid! declarative
We_need_to_look_at_the_big_picture_in_deciding_which_bid_to_accept. declarative
What_things_would_you_like_me_to_look_at? interrogative
Just_because_a_buyer_offers_the_money_doesn't_mean_that_they_actually_have_the_credit_to_purchase_the_home. declarative

What_matters_besides_getting_the_money_for_the_house? interrogative
We_need_to_make_sure_that_these_potential_buyers_all_actually_qualify_to_even_purchase_a_home. declarative
I_don't_even_know_where_to_begin_checking_on_a_buyer's_credit_information. declarative
We_can_check_to_see_if_these_buyers_have_already_sold_their_current_home. declarative
This_would_make_them_more_desirable. declarative
I_think_that_gathering_that_information_will_be_helpful_to_me. declarative

Afterwards,_you_should_head_to_the_Museum_to_enjoy_the_art. declarative
That_sounds_like_a_plan. declarative
I'm_sure_you'll_have_a_good_time_there. declarative
I_was_told_to_see_you_about_going_sightseeing. declarative
I'm_the_hotel's_concierge,_at_your_service. declarative

I'm_not_familiar_with_that_word. declarative
A_concierge_directs_visitors_to_the_city's_great_tourist,_shopping,_and_eating_places. declarative
Now,_is_there_any_place_that_I_should_hit_first? interrogative
Well,_if_you're_like_most_people,_you'll_want_to_go_to_the_Statue_of_Liberty. declarative
I've_already_seen_it,_I_loved_it,_but_today_I_want_to_go_somewhere_else. declarative

Tell_me_about_the_alternatives. interrogative
We_run_a_fully_equipped_computer_lab_on_the_first_floor. declarative
How_much_does_that_cost? interrogative
The_service_is_free_to_hotel_patrons. declarative
However,_printing_costs_ten_cents_per_page. declarative

You_would_have_to_use_the_computer_lab. declarative

And_if_I_need_to_print_something_there? declarative
Well,_we_don't_have_a_printer_in_the_lobby_yet. declarative
You'll_have_to_use_the_lab. declarative
I'd_like_to_get_busy_on_my_computer,_but_I_need_some_broadband. declarative
There's_an_Ethernet_cable_in_your_room. declarative
Just_plug_it_into_the_back_of_your_laptop. imperative

Well,_there's_our_computer_lab_on_the_first_floor. declarative
What's_the_charge? interrogative
The_lab_and_the_computers_are_no_charge,_but_you_have_to_pay_for_whatever_you_print. declarative
Now,_how_about_the_other_alternatives? interrogative
Our_lobby_is_set_up_for_wireless,_so_just_bring_your_computer_down_here. imperative

Now,_if_I_need_to_print_something_there? declarative

Just_plug_the_Ethernet_cable_into_your_computer,_and_you'll_be_off_and_running. imperative
That_would_be_okay_if_I_had_an_Ethernet_port. declarative
Unfortunately,_my_laptop_uses_wireless_only. declarative
In_that_case,_let_me_tell_you_about_some_alternatives. declarative

For_starters,_we_have_a_computer_lab. declarative

Now_tell_me_about_the_other_alternatives. imperative

We're_set_up_for_wireless_right_here. declarative
I_like_that_suggestion,_but_what_if_I_need_to_print_something_there? declarative
Unfortunately,_you'll_have_to_go_to_the_computer_lab_for_your_printing_needs. declarative
How_do_I_get_online_with_my_laptop? interrogative
Just_plug_the_Ethernet_cable_into_your_computer,_and_you'll_be_online_in_a_heartbeat. imperative
I_see_the_cable. declarative
But_my_computer_runs_on_wireless_only. declarative
I'll_tell_you_about_our_alternatives. declarative
Yes,_I'd_love_to_hear_what_the_alternatives_are. declarative
Our_state-of-the-art_computer_lab_is_on_the_first_floor. declarative
But_is_it_free? interrogative
Sir,_the_computers_are_free_to_guests,_but_you_do_have_to_pay_a_nominal_printing_fee. declarative
You_said_there_were_other_alternatives? interrogative
Just_use_your_computer_here_in_the_lobby. imperative
It's_set_up_for_wireless. declarative
That_sounds_like_a_winner. declarative
Now_if_I_need_to_print_something_in_the_lobby? interrogative
We_might_have_a_printer_here_next_month. declarative
But_for_now,_you'll_have_to_go_to_the_lab. declarative
My_amenities_bill_says_that_I_owe_$10_for_a_movie,_but_I_never_ordered_one. declarative
Let's_see. imperative
It_says_that_you_were_charged_Monday_at_9:00_p.m. declarative
for_the_movie_"Titanic." imperative
That's_absolutely_wrong! declarative
I_was_out_exploring_the_city_Monday_night. declarative
Okay,_let_me_see_what_I_can_do. declarative
I_didn't_think_it_would_be_this_simple. declarative
